"# Lexicon-Valmiki-Ramayan" 



Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Ramayana, an ancient Sanskrit epic, by extracting Sanskrit-English word pairs and analyzing their syntactic and semantic meanings. We gathered data directly from the Valmiki Ramayana website (https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/), which provides both Sanskrit verses and their English translations. The goal is to process this data for further linguistic research, including phonetic transliterations, and to understand the roles of words in the context of the Ramayana.
